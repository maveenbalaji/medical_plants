Plant Leaf ID App

Overview

The Plant Leaf ID App is a Flutter-based mobile application that leverages machine learning to instantly identify plant species from leaf photos. This app provides users with accurate names, classifications, and 

essential care information about the plants they encounter. By combining ML technology and an intuitive design, the app aims to foster a deeper appreciation for the natural world and assist plant enthusiasts in 

recognizing and caring for various species.

Features

Instant Plant Identification: Capture a leaf photo, and the app will instantly identify the plant species.

Accurate Classification: Get reliable scientific names and classifications for the plants you discover.

Care Information: Detailed care instructions are provided for each plant, helping users maintain healthy plants.

Machine Learning: Powered by advanced ML algorithms for accurate and efficient plant recognition.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI makes it easy for users to interact with the app and get results quickly.

Tech Stack

Flutter: Cross-platform development framework for building the app.

Dart: Programming language used in Flutter development.

Machine Learning (ML): Model used for plant identification and classification.

Image Processing: Advanced techniques to enhance plant recognition accuracy.

How It Works

Capture a Leaf Photo: Users take a picture of a plant leaf using the device camera.

ML Model Processing: The image is processed by an ML model trained to identify plant species based on leaf characteristics.

Identification & Info Display: The app displays the plant's name, classification, and care information.

Learning & Care: Users can explore the app to learn more about plants and how to care for them.

Future Improvements

Expanded Database: Increase the number of identifiable plants to cover a wider range of species.

Offline Mode: Allow plant identification without an internet connection by embedding the ML model locally.

User Contributions: Enable users to submit images and information about plants to improve the database.
